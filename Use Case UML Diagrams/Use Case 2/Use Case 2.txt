title USE CASE 2
#Summery
#This use case requires two Databases and two sets of UI participants. the "Nutritional Database" provides Nutrition information (provided), and the "Database" stores user data. For adding a meal the data should flow from the user, to the database, then back to the user passing through the Nutrition calculator which takes it's information from the Nutritional Database to derive the nutritional information of the meal. To get the detailed breakdown of the meal in the Journal view The same data flow is used, but instead of the data coming from the user it comes from the saved data already in in the Database.
